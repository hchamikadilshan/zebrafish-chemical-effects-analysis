# zebrafish-chemical-effects-analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the effects of various chemicals (Be, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, Ba, Ti, Pb and U) on zebrafish behavior during light and dark phases. Using a multiple regression approach, the aim is to identify which chemicals most significantly influence zebrafish movement.

## Files
- `data/`: Contains the datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks where the regression analysis is performed.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and model building.
- `results/`: Results from the regression models.
## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
## Future Work
Further analysis will be conducted using other machine learning models to enhance the understanding of the zebrafish behavioral responses to these chemicals.
